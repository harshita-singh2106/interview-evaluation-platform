# AI-Based Interview Evaluation Platform

## Problem Statement
Many students prepare for technical and HR interviews, but they often do not receive proper feedback on their answers. Most existing platforms only provide interview questions or mock tests without evaluating the quality of responses. As a result, students are unable to identify their strengths, weaknesses, and areas for improvement.  

This project aims to develop a web-based interview evaluation platform that conducts mock interviews and analyzes candidate responses using basic NLP techniques. The system provides structured feedback and performance scores to help students improve their interview skills in a more guided and effective manner.

## Objectives
1. To conduct structured mock interviews for students based on selected roles.  
2. To generate role-specific interview questions.  
3. To evaluate candidate answers using keyword and semantic analysis techniques.  
4. To provide clear feedback highlighting strengths and improvement areas.  
5. To track interview performance and progress over multiple attempts.
